# DinoGame
This game was made for the eYSRC (e-Yantra School Robotics Competition) 2021 held by IIT Bombay, for which we won the Best Code award!

It recreates the classic Chrome Dino game, with an added storyline, and two new maps, each with its own theme, animated background, and well-suiting obstacles!
